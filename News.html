                                The Geneva-based organization said in a press release today: “The Israeli bombing of Gaza has intensified in an unprecedented manner until northern Gaza is leveled to the ground, while all parts of the Strip are being bombarded without leaving any safe haven for civilians.” Despite the issuance of a resolution by the United Nations General Assembly establishing a humanitarian truce, this did not achieve any results on the ground, as the violent Israeli bombing continued. It also called on the international community to take stricter measures to pressure Israel to stop its aggression, stressing that civilians are being killed and forcibly displaced from their homes, and water and fuel continue to run out, while atrocities in Gaza have reached an extent that we have not seen before.

                                Al-Orabi added, in a statement to the Middle East News Agency on Monday, that the attempt of the International Criminal Court delegation to enter the Gaza Strip to determine the reality of the situation confirms that there is an insistence on investigating the massacres committed by the occupying state against innocent civilians in the Gaza Strip and that these crimes will not go unpunished. .
                                
                                Al-Orabi noted that there has been a noticeable change in the position of the countries that have supported the occupying state since October 7th. There is a clear decline in its support for Israel, especially since the war crimes being carried out in the Gaza Strip are being watched by the whole world and are even being documented in light of the technological progress of communications.
                                
                                The former Foreign Minister believed that some of Israel's supporters who gave it the "right to self-defense" found themselves accused before their people and world public opinion of participating in the killing of civilians, children and women due to Israel's lack of respect for the rules of war and international legitimacy and its adoption of a policy of collective punishment and extermination.
